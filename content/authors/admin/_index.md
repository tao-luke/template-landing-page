I am a 4th year computer science student with both experience and interest in embedded systems. Currently, I am a firmware engineer intern at Sibros working on vehicle RTOS. Before this, I was an URA at UWaterloo for high performance user threading research. In the coming winter, I will be interning in Palo Alto at Tesla as a vehicle firmware engineer.

I work comfortably in:
* C ( OpenSSL, mBedTLS, GDB, Valgrind )
* C++ ( Unity test, Google test )
* CMake, Make, Bazel
* Python ( Numpy, Pytorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn )
* Matlab

Outside of academics, I am a passionate climber and an avid fan of philosophy and combinatorics.
